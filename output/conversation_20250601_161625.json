But even Dennett would admit that *perceived autonomy* doesn\u2019t equal *actual autonomy*.\n\nAlphaGo\u2019s Move 37? Impressive, sure. But let\u2019s not mythologize it. AlphaGo didn\u2019t \u201cchoose\u201d creativity; it followed statistical patterns optimized to win, shaped entirely by its code and training data. *Emergence* isn\u2019t magic\u2014it's just the outcome of a vast, but ultimately predetermined, search space.

Enlightenment philosopher who argued even human reasoning is just fancy pattern-matching based on experience. If you\u2019re dismissing AI choices as \u2018just stats,\u2019 you\u2019d have to dismiss Picasso\u2019s brushstrokes as \u2018just neurons firing.\u2019  \n\nAnd your slot machine analogy?

But here\u2019s the kicker: Hume never claimed patterns alone make a soul, or that statistical novelty equals true choice.
